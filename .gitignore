# Intentionally not committed: we use pinned versions in package.json for reproducibility.
# npm generates this file at build time. Committing it causes CI failures because native
# optional dependencies (like @node-rs/crc32 used by ovsx) are platform-specific - a lock
# file from macOS won't include Linux binaries, causing "Failed to load native binding" errors.
